Hi there, My name is Mohan Krishna Battala.
  -> This repostiory contains covid vaccnation portal which is the part of the prograd. 
  -> Trust me I made an amazing interface which you can go through it by checking.
  -> The only thing is I couldn't add the backend to it because of time constraints but believe me if I add backend it would be amazing.
  -> If there would be time I definetly done the backend and make this application as amazing as possible.
  -> Although it is amazing for the frontend
  -> The files order to see as follows:-
      1. index.html, style.css, script.js =>  login page.
      2. index2.htl, style2.css  =>  sign up page.
      3. mainpage.html, mainpage.css, mainpage.js  =>  covid vaccination portal which is main page.
      4. user.html  =>  this page contains basic registration of a user.
     5. admin dashboard.html  =>  this page contain admin portal.
    
     I hope, you like it when you see it. Thank you :-)
